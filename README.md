# Building Apps with Kotlin on Android Studio IDE

Hello everyone! So here I've committed some examples that's been given in class during my studies at Generation Brazil' Mobile Kotlin Bootcamp.
If you want a more straigh forward approach, the Todo App compiles all the topics I've learned at the program and gives a better understanding on how all tools works together. 

## üöÄ Getting Starter

These instructions will allow you to make a working copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### üìã Prerequisites
